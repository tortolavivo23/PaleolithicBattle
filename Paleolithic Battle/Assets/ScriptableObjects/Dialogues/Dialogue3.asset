  - currentMsg: " Tika\u2026 something feels different."
  - currentMsg: Because this is it. The final battle.
  - currentMsg: Zor feels the ground shake.
  - currentMsg: "Here, running and hitting won\u2019t be enough. Everything we learned...
      now we must use it."
  - currentMsg: Everything?
  - currentMsg: Move smart. Strike with purpose. Capture fast. Save. Recruit. Defend.
      And think every step.
  - currentMsg: Zor is ready. Where are they?
  - currentMsg: Everywhere. But the key is the center.
  - currentMsg: ' The center?'
  - currentMsg: "Yes. If we take the center, we gain more caves, more huts. More
      money each turn. More paths to strike. Whoever controls the center\u2026 controls
      the map."
  - currentMsg: Then Zor will take the center.
  - currentMsg: "Carefully. Don\u2019t go alone. If they ambush you, it\u2019ll be
      hard to take it back."
  - currentMsg: Zor thinks now. Zor is not who he was.
  - currentMsg: "Neither am I. Now we fight like tribe leaders. With strength\u2026
      and wisdom."
  - currentMsg: "Then let it begin. Final battle\u2026 final turn!"

  - currentMsg: Tika! The river tribe is coming! They're crossing the plain!
  - currentMsg: Listen, Zor. Your turn has begun. You can move each unit once. Then
      they can attack or capture.
  - currentMsg: Capture what?
  - currentMsg: Tipis, huts, and caves. Caves give us money every turn if we control
      them.
  - currentMsg: What do we do with the money?
  - currentMsg: Use it to recruit more units in huts. And if you save enough you
      can even recruit a powerful unit.
  - currentMsg: Zor wants more caves. More huts.
  - currentMsg: 'Then go and take them. But remember: If they capture our tipi, we
      lose. If you capture theirs, we win.'
  - currentMsg: Zor understands. What about fighting?
  - currentMsg: When you attack, you can play a minigame. Win it, and you deal extra
      damage. Lose it, you deal less damage. Skip it, and you deal normal damage.
  - currentMsg: Zor chooses wisely. Zor thinks.
  - currentMsg: "There\u2019s more. If you defeat all their units, we win. But if
      we lose all our units, we lose\u2026 even if our tipi still stands."
  - currentMsg: " Zor has many ways to win\u2026 and many ways to lose."
  - currentMsg: Exactly. Attack with thought. Capture with strategy. And protect
      your warriors like you protect fire.
  - currentMsg: Zor is ready. Zor goes east. Zor takes his turn!

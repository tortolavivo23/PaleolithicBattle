  - currentMsg: "Tika... now it\u2019s your turn. The enemies are coming from the
      south! And they bring mammoths!"
  - currentMsg: "Yes\u2026 I see them. Heavy units. Big, strong\u2026 But they can\u2019t
      climb the mountain."
  - currentMsg: "They can\u2019t get through there?"
  - currentMsg: "No. They\u2019re too big. The mountain is a wall for them. But I
      can stay up high\u2026 and attack from afar."
  - currentMsg: "Zor understands. They can\u2019t reach you."
  - currentMsg: "Exactly. There\u2019s no extra damage or extra defense here\u2026
      But from up high, I strike, and they can\u2019t hit back."
  - currentMsg: Zor crushes. Tika thinks.
  - currentMsg: "That\u2019s why we\u2019re winning. I have to hold the high ground
      and stop them from surrounding us. If I play my turn right\u2026 their mammoths
      will never get close."
  - currentMsg: Zor watches and learns. Tika fights like the wind. Far. Steady. Deadly.
  - currentMsg: "And Zor guards the tipi. If they climb, it\u2019ll be from another
      side. Now they\u2019ll see that being big isn\u2019t enough."
